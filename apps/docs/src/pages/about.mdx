# About React Awesome Components

Hi guys! My name is [Thinh](https://github.com/trinhthinh388), I've been working as a Fronend Developer for more than {new Date().getFullYear() - 2020} years. During my career, there are so many
components or UI logic that could be reused in the other projects. Thus, I've seen so many libraries having different names but just do exactly same thing,
it makes me tired of choosing the library to best fit my needs. That's why **React Awesome Components** was born.

With **React Awesome Components** you don't have to spend time on finding the next package to use in your project. Just install `@react-awesome/components`.

One package to solve every problem.
